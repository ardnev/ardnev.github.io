  <h1>just an afterthought</h1>
  <p class="fade">One day you’ll search for me in everyone you meet but I won’t be found.</p>
  <p class="fade">I don’t know when one day will be. But it’s a day we both look forward to and regret. Because on that day I’ll be over you. I won’t want you the way I’ve wanted you for so long. I won’t pine after you the way I have. You won’t be every thought that consumes me in a busy day. I will have moved on. And you’ll be just another story in the past. </p>
  <p class="fade">You’ll miss the little conversations where we used to only talk about you. You’ll miss the texts you used to ignore followed by double one. You’ll replay voice mails just to hear the sound of my voice. You’ll find yourself looking at my pictures remembering when you were a main character in my life or at least I wanted you to be. You’ll remember how I told you every detail of what was going on. And you’ll miss having someone to tell those things to. Someone who genuinely cared about your well-being and happiness. So much so, I put it before my own. You’ll miss the messages that popped up during a busy day. You’ll miss someone caring even though it wasn’t reciprocated. You’ll simply miss someone being around that you took for granted. And when those moments of missing me hit you like a ton bricks, what you’ll regret is not realizing what you had when you could have had it. Not giving me the chance I probably deserved.</p>
  <h2 class="fade">just maybe...</h2>
  
  <p class="fade"> Maybe I’ll meet you in dreams that haunt you.

Maybe then you’ll realize.

Maybe you’ll be lying next to someone you wish was me

Maybe you’ll build up the courage to check up on me.

Maybe you’re just wondering if I still care.</p>

  <p class="fade">I think no matter how much time passes you’re someone I’ll always care for and love deeply. But I couldn’t keep waiting for you to love me back. I played every best card I had trying to get you to love me. What I realized was it wasn’t supposed to be that hard. But there was no doubt I loved you. </p>
